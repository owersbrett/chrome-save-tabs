# Save Tabs

Save Tabs is a chrome extension that allows saving all opened tabs to json or plain text.

## Features

... or why yet another tab list extension?

- It requires minimal permissions
- It does not communicate with a server
- It works completely offline
- You can decide on the format of the files (plain text or JSON)
- You can choose between saving the list to a file or simply opening it in the specified format in a new tab

So, as you see it has a pretty strong focus on privacy. I think this is enough arguments.
